# `brain-lab`

_A Science Institute Workflow for Brain Lab_

## Description

TODO: finish description.

Welcome to the Science Institute Brain Lab pipeline!

This service is designed for a user to upload their raw [_modality type_] data acquired with [_description_], which will then be automatically processed with [_..._]. The service also provides online Jupyter notebooks to visualize the results.

This [workflow](https://github.com/iamamutt/science-institute_brain-lab) uses components from open-source packages, including the DataJoint Elements:

- element and url
- element and url

Please follow the steps listed below to begin working with the platform.

## Using the SciOps Services

### Account Setup

1. Create a free account at [accounts.datajoint.io](https://accounts.datajoint.io/signup)

| :---------- | :--------------------- | ---------------------: |
| Schemas     | Tables within a schema | Entries within a table |

**Enter subject information**

- In the left column, navigate to the `subject` schema
- In the middle column, navigate to the `Subject` table
- In the right column, `Insert` a new subject

**Enter session information**

- In the left column, navigate to the `session` schema
- In the middle column, navigate to the `Session` table
- In the right column, `Insert` a new experimental session for the
  subject

![labbook session](docs/assets/setup/labbook_session.png)

**Enter session directory information**

- In the left column, navigate to the `session` schema
- In the middle column, navigate to the `SessionDirectory` table
- In the right column, `Insert` a new entry to identify where the data
  is located (relative to the `inbox` directory)

### DataJoint Axon (Data Upload/Download)


#### Axon GUI 



1. In the Axon app, on the lower left side, click the 'gear' icon (Config). Enter the following information in each field (See the `Misc` section below for what the generated `json` config file will look like once configured):

- AWS Account ID: `123456789012`

- DataJoint Account Client ID: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

- S3 Role: `science-institute_brain-lab_researcher_prod`

- S3 Bucket: `dj-sciops`

2. At the top right of the Axon app, click the 'circle arrow' icon (Token). This will open a browser to be able to sign in with your DataJoint account and generate a temporary token.

3. Select the 'S3 Bucket' tab on the left side of the Axon app. Enter the following information to view the current list of files uploaded, the press 'Load':

- S3 Bucket Directory: `science-institute_brain-lab/inbox/`

4. To upload a folder to a subfolder within the 'S3 Bucket Directory', for example to upload the subject data folder 'SUBJ100' from your local machine, enter the following path on S3: `science-institute_brain-lab/inbox/SUBJ100`

#### Axon CLI

#### Misc

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",

Thank you for using the Science Institute: _Brain Lab_ cloud-based platform.

## Installation

!!! note
    The following is intended for developers and is not required for users of the SciOps services.

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone a local copy of the [project repository](https://github.com/iamamutt/science-institute_brain-lab) and change to the location of that directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamamutt/science-institute_brain-lab.git
cd "brain-lab"
```

### 2. Create a new python environment

We recommend creating an isolated [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to avoid any conflicts with your existing Python packages or interpreter. You can create a virtual environment by first installing [`conda`/`mamba`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge):

1. Create an environment using the packages listed in `environment.yml`:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml --force
```

2. Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate brain_lab
```

### 3. Install the package `brain-lab`

After the new virtual environment has been created and activated, install this python package using `pip>=62.0` (`pip` is already in the list of requirements from the `environment.yml` file).

To avoid installing other additional packages, use the following command (see [_contrib_](./CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-local-development-environment) for extra installing packages):

```bash
pip install .
```

If you need to uninstall the package, do so with `pip`:

```bash
pip uninstall brain-lab
```

#### Additional setup for local development and testing

See the [_Development setup_](./CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-local-development-environment) documentation for information on how to install additional packages and tools for local development and testing environments.
